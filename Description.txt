Dataset Overview: 
Mobile device usage dataset containing 700 samples of user data, covering metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption.

Key Features:

User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Device Model: User’s smartphone model.
Operating System: OS of the device (iOS or Android).
App Usage Time: Daily time spent on applications (minutes).
Screen On Time: Daily active screen hours.
Battery Drain: Daily battery usage (mAh).
Number of Apps Installed: Count of apps on the device.
Data Usage: Daily mobile data consumption (MB).
Age, Gender: Demographic features.
User Behavior Class: Usage pattern class (1 to 5).
Objective: To classify user behavior into one of five categories based on mobile usage patterns, aiding in understanding mobile user behavior for potential predictive modeling applications.

Process:
Data Visualization:  
Explored relationships between variables and checked for correlations among features.

Model Selection & Training: 
Tested Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN models on the dataset.


Performance Comparison: 
Evaluated each model’s accuracy and performance to identify the most effective approach for user behavior classification.


This task highlights feature analysis and comparative model evaluation, ideal for developing insights into mobile usage behavior through machine learning.
